<h1 >Introducing École</h1>
<p>
	Ecole (pronounced [ekɔl]) stands for
	<span style="font-style: italic;">Extensible Combinatorial Optimization Learning
	Environments</span> and aims to expose a number of control problems arising in
	combinatorial optimization solvers as Markov
	Decision Processes (<span style="font-style: italic;">i.e.</span>, Reinforcement
	Learning environments).
	Rather than trying to predict solutions to combinatorial optimization problems directly, the
	philosophy behind Ecole is to work
	in cooperation with a state-of-the-art Mixed Integer Linear Programming solver
	that acts as a controllable algorithm.
</p>
<p>
	The underlying solver used is <a href="https://scip.zib.de/" target="_blank">SCIP</a>, and the user
	facing API is meant to mimic the <a href="https://gym.openai.com/" target="_blank">OpenAI Gym</a>
	API (as much as possible).
