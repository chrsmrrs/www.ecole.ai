title: Introducing Ecole
---

Ecole (pronounced [ek…îl]) stands for _Extensible Combinatorial Optimization Learning
Environments_ and aims to expose a number of control problems arising in combinatorial
optimization solvers as Markov
Decision Processes (_i.e._, Reinforcement Learning environments).
Rather than trying to predict solutions to combinatorial optimization problems directly, the
philosophy behind Ecole is to work
in cooperation with a state-of-the-art Mixed Integer Linear Programming solver
that acts as a controllable algorithm.

The underlying solver used is [SCIP](https://scip.zib.de/), and the user facing API is
meant to mimic the [OpenAi Gym](https://gym.openai.com/) API (as much as possible).
