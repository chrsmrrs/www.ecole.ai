The problems in discrete optimization are everywhere around us.
It appears in the form of deciding which route to follow to get to the destination (Shortest Path Problem), fitting luggage in the trunk of the car (Bin Packing Problem), or planning a multi-city trip to name a few.
Even when we are not the ones to handle them, we regularly interact with them indirectly.
For example, a "prime" customer from Amazon will have a direct impact on the package deliver route (Traveling Salesman Problem), or our shopping preference influences the items that a nearby supermarket stocks up.
Zooming out from our daily life, such problems arise naturally in many areas like computational biology, policy planning, supply chain management etc.
Thus, the organizations and researchers in these field rely on solving them.

## WIP
Most widely solved discrete optimization problems are linear in nature i.e. with linear objective function and linear constraints.
Even with such relaxed conditions, discrete nature of decision variables make them non-convex.
This is in contrast to the continuous optimization problems where the continuity of decision variables enables a polynomial time search for the solution.
However, problems like shortest path

discrete and continuous; what makes them discrete; some problems are polynomially solvable
others are NP-complete; so we use wither approximations or exact frameworks like branch and bound
